# A-Machine-Learning-approach-of-Ecological-Modeling-A-New-method-to-find-Similarity-Index
In many scientific research, it’s often imperative to determine whether pairs of
entities have similarities in themselves or not. There are standard approaches to
this problem such as Jaccard, Sørensen-Dice , and Simpson . Recently, a better index for analysis of Co-Occurrence and similarity (αˆ) was developed and
it reversed all the results obtained by Standard Indices and supported theoretical
predictions. In this paper, we propose a new measure of similarity using Maximum Likelihood Estimation , Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant
Analysis , and clustering. Our index depends strongly on the data before introducing randomness in prevalence. Then we proposed a new method of randomization, which changed the whole pattern of the results. Before randomization, it was
strongly dependent on the prevalance and hence was following the pattern of the Jaccard index. So, we introduced the new randomization technique and hence the
whole results reversed and followed that of αˆ . Also, we will show some limitations of αˆ which we try to resolve through different pathways.
